Type constraint control the type of variable values

1. primitive - string type values - single type values
    number, string, bool
        replicas = 3
        name = "cluster-1"
        bool = true

2. Complex types of single variable
        list = [1,2,3,4]
        tuple = 
        map
        object

    2.1 Collection allows multiple values of one primitive type to be grouped together
            Constructors for these collections include:
                list (type) - 
                map  (type)
                set  (type)

            variable "family" {
                type = lsit(string)
                default = ["a","bbbb", "kodali"]
            } 
    2.2 Structural types allow multiple values of different primitive types to be grouped together
            Constructors for these collections include:
                object (type)
                tuple (type)
                set (type)

            variable "instructor" {
                type = object({
                    name = string
                    age = number
                })
            }
3. Dynamic types -
    3.1  any constraint - any placeholder for a primitive type is yetto be decided. Type will be determined on runtime

        variable "data" {
            type = list(any)
            default = [1,3,77,9]
        }
