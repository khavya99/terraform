state file is saved locally by default.
but can save state file remotely usually to remote data sources.
    eg: s3, gcp storage bucket
full remote storage supported resource details will be available in terraform website

Remote state files can be accessed by multipla teams.
Remote state storage - Allows state locking - so multiple executions dont collide
                     - also contains output values to ur terraform code - which means those output values can be used by 
                       other terraform projects or code - mostly used by remote teams
