Provisioners -ex: defining the connection method to a VM like ssh. These shd be used at last if we dont have any other choice,
else use inherit mechanism to carryout custom tasks

There are 2 types of provisioners
1. Creation-time provisioner
2. Destroy-time provisioner

resource "null_resource" "dummy_resource" {
    provisioner "local-exec" {
        command = "echo '0' > status.txt"
    }

    local-exec is a keyword -- which specifies its a local provisioner

    provisioner "local-exec" {
        when = destroy
        command = "echo '1' > status.txt"
    }
}

provisioners are executed in sequence they are written in
