1. Best way to deploy tf code and deployments:
      1. Hashicorp sentinel
      2. TF vault provider
2. difference b/w tf OSS (open source software) and enterprice offerings
3. summarize benefits and usage of tf cloud

Hashicorp sentinel:
  1. framework that enforces policies (restrictions) on tf code
  2. avoid accidental deploymments
  3. codification - easy understanding and better colloboration
  4. version control
  5. test and automation
use case:
  1. for enforcing CIS standards  across AWS account
  2. checking only t2.micro instances are used

Terraform Valut: 
  Terraform/hasicorp vault for injecting secrets securely.
  secrets management
  store sensitive data securely
  dynamically provides creds and rotate them securely
  encrypts sensitive data at rest and in transit and privides access to secrets using ACLs
      ex of data stored is:
          1. usernames and passwords
          2. db creds
          3. API tokens
          4. TLS certs
  
Terraform registry and terraform cloud workspace:
    Fetching a provider or module from tf registry is built in tf workflow by default
Terraform Clous workspace:
    Workspaces are hosted on terraform cloud
    All tf commanda are executed on managed tf cloud VMs


                    ***** Terraform OSS workspace *****                        vs                   ***** Terraform cloud workspace *****
                    stores alternate state files in same working directory
TF config           stored on disk                                                                    In linked version control repo or periodically uploaded via API/CLI
Variable Values     as .tfvars file as CLi arguments or shell env                                     In workspace in TF cloud
State               On disk or remote backend                                                         In workspace (In terraform cloud)
creds and secrets   In shell env or entered at prompts                                                In workspace (terraform cloud) stored as sensitive vars
