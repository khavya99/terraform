TF_LOG is env variable for enabling verbose logging in tf.
by default it sends logs to stderr (standard error output).

logging can be set to following levels: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
TRACE is most verbose level of logging and reliable one
To persist logged output , use TF_LOG_PATH env variable (which takes a file as an input)

By default tf_log is disabled. to ste it we need to follow below.
  export TF_LOG=TRACE
  export TF_LOG_PATH=./terraform.log
