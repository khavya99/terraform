terraform workspaces are alternate state files with in same working directory
tf starts with a single workspace thats always called default. it cant be deleted
each work space will track different state file that corresponds to that directory

terraform workspace subcommand example                         use
  1. terraform workspace new <workspace-name>            create workspace
  2. terraform workspace select <workspace-name>         select workspace

use of workspace:
  1. test changes using parallel, distinct copy of infra
  2. it can be modelled against branches in version control such as git

workspaces are meant to share resources and help to enable colloboration.
access workspace name - ${terraform.workspace}

example-1:
  resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      count = terraform.workspace == "default" ? 5:1
      # other args
  }

example-2:
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
    bucket = "my-bucket-${terraform.workspace}"
    acl = "private"
}

*** current workspace state file will be stored in terraform.tfstate
    other workspace state files will be stored in terraform.tfstate.d
